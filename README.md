#  All The Good News 
All The Good News is a web app that lets users leave comments on the latest news. Read up and feel the warmth in your heart. 

## How Does It Work?
When a user visits the site, the app will scrape stories from Good News Network. The data will include a button that links to the story as well as a headline, photo, and byline. Cheerio will grab the site content and Mongoose saves it a MongoDB database. Users can leave comments on the stories and delete whatever comments they want removed. All stored comments are visible to every user.
